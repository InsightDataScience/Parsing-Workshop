# Parsing-Workshop

This is [Insight's](www.insightdevopengineering.com) workshop to help our DevOps Fellows prepare for parsing interviews.
In this workshop, we cover Bash fundamentals (as well as awk, sed and the likes) as well as specific parsing modules in Python.
The workshop is mostly exercise driven and thus only really useful if all exercises are completed.

## Prerequisites

We expect that you...

- ... have written a very basic Bash script before.
- ... are familiar with basic Python data structures (such as variables, lists and dictionary).
- ... do not just read through the workshop but actually work on all exercises!

## How to walk through this workshop

The main guiding blocks of the workshops are the different chapters.

- Fork this repository and then clone it!
- In each chapter, work through the README.md file and record the answers to the exercises in Bash and Python scripts.
- At the end of some chapters, there are links to certain more involved exercises. These exercises can all be found in the [exercises](.exercises) folder.
  - Solve those exercises in Bash and Python and save your solutions in the folder of the exercise.
- Pair up with fellow Fellows and do a code review on your solutions.
- Feel free to add exercises yourself, we are happy to review pull requests and incorporate them.

## Where do I get started?

Let us get started in [chapter 1](./chapter1/README.md).
